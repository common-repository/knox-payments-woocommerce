#Knox Payments Wordpress plugin

Ideally this should be a simply add water and off you go plugin.


## Testing
* Tests are done with [Casper.js](http://casperjs.org/), to run the tests do:

```
rake test
```
* BEWARE! Tests are currently contingent on vagrant running and you having entered the apropriate API key and password (it can be anything)
* The vagrant machine is from [vagrantpress](https://github.com/chad-thompson/vagrantpress)
