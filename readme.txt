== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* What is Knox?
Knox is a payment processing system that connects customers’ banks with a merchant to enable electronic payments.

* How does it work?
A customer simply selects his or her bank and enters a username and password to make a payment directly to the merchant.

* What does it cost?
The first 10 payments each month with Knox are totally free as are all payments under $2.00. Payments after that are only 18¢ each.

* Is Knox safe?
Knox uses a layer of additional security atop your online banking to safely process your payment. We never store banking information and we never send it to the merchant.
